# FeatureDummyApp
An App for feature testing with Fuse (https://www.fusetools.com/).

In the app are the following features available and testet:
1.GeoLoaction
2.Camera
3.Phone
4.WebView
5.Maps
6.Notificatino
7.Vibration
8.Load and display some JSON data from a server (PerformanceTest)


I create the app for my bachelor thesis and exactly the same app with Xcode and Swift. I compared both apps in my thesis.
